## Regression-Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Prediction
A bike-sharing system provides people with a sustainable mode of transportation and has beneficial effects for both the environment and the user. In recent days, Pubic rental bike sharing is becoming popular because of is increased comfortableness and environmental sustainability. Data used include Seoul Bike and Capital Bikeshare program data. Data have weather data associated with it for each hour. For the dataset, we are using linear regression model were train with optimize hyperparameters using a repeated cross validation approach and testing set is used for evaluation. Multiple evaluation indices such as Mean squared error , Root Mean Square error, r2 score,adjusted r2 score are use to measure the prediction performance of the regression models.
## Problem Statement
Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city
with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a
major concern. The crucial part is the
prediction of bike count required at each hour
for the stable supply of rental bikes.

The main objective is to make predictive
model, which could help them in predicting
the bike demands proactively. This will help
them in stable supply of bike wherever
needed.
