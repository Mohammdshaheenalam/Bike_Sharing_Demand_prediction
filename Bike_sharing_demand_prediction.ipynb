Data used include Seoul Bike and Capital Bikeshare program data. Data have weather data associated with it for each hour. For the dataset, we are using linear regression model were train with optimize hyperparameters using a repeated cross validation approach and testing set is used for evaluation. Multiple evaluation indices such as Mean squared error , Root Mean Square error, r2 score,adjusted r2 score are use to measure the prediction performance of the regression models."
